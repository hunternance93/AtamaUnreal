And so, aboard that boat I was able to escape from that town and evade the peering gaze of the interlopers. In truth, I don't know the significance of the crow's gift.

All I know is that this overwhelming feeling of the object's importance overcame me the moment I touched it. While I know I have only seen small, fragmentary glimpses of what exists at the core of this world, I have been filled with a glimmer of hope.

My journey back home felt almost instantaneous. As though I arrived home seconds after getting off that boat. Then I saw Tomoko. She was so much bigger than when I last saw her. Perhaps it had been longer than I thought.

I handed her the crow's gift and told her that although I couldn't explain it, that it was imperative she keep it safe forever. In her eyes was a mix of fear, anxiety, and shock, yet in her head I could tell that she completely believed me.

As I turned to leave, she hugged me and begged me not to leave again. It was difficult, but if the things I see aren't real then I am a burden on them, and if they are then I am a danger. I never had a choice.

So, now I wander again waiting for the inevitable future.
