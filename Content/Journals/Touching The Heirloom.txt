I cannot explain the things I've seen. Am I going mad? No one believes me.

I was cleaning the dojo like any other day, but when I went downstairs the Meio family heirloom was shrouded in a green glow...

I reached out and the glowing stopped. But, on the way home everything was a little off... like I had stepped into another world. The air was filled with a strange discoloration and the town was empty. Akikawacho's town square is never empty. 

When I woke up the next day I thought everything was back to normal at first, but then I saw that thing. That wretched thing floating in the air. 

It keeps happening again and getting worse. 

It has only been a month, how bad will it be in a year? I don't know what to do, I just want to go back I don't want to see these things anymore!! I'm tired of being looked at!!!
