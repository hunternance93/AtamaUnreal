My name is Ikuto Nakamatsu. I have always been able to see things that others cannot. However, as I have grown older the visions have grown stronger. 

How many years have passed since my family rejected me? Even now despite traveling so far, I still often see through my wife's tearstained eyes after she puts Tomoko to bed and lies restlessly in her futon. 

The truth is, I envy them. I have seen the rot that permeates the core of this world, and I know it will not be contained for long. I wish I could live naively and contendendly as oblivion approaches, but there are fates worse than death in this world.

I know I am close now. The crows have been guiding me for some time. Soon, I will be able to protect my bloodline, even if they will never understand.
