I want to be as delicate as possible. What happened to Meio-sensei's daughter is an absolute tragedy and I truly feel horrible for him.

However, the men need to be trained. They are growing weak and complacent in the abscence of a leader and many are turning to gambling and drinking. We are not a huge village, and we cannot expect timely aid from the government. 

Meio-sensei is locking himself in his manor while I receive more and more reports from the West of ex-samurai and peasants alike turning to banditry. As a wealthy and developing settlement, we are sitting here with a target on our back at a time where we need leadership and strong men.

I know I am still young, but please, allow me to train the men in his place, if he cannot protect Akikawacho then I will.
