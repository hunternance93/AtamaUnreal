Thank you for coming to visit me. I am currently out of town as I am helping to oversee the completion of the Kisaragi Shrine and I do not anticipate returning for many months. Please leave any mail with Kogoro. If there is anything urgent then please let Yuuta know before he leaves to join us in Kisaragi.
