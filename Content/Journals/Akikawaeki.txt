Akikawa Station -- Looking for Workers

We are all excited about Akikawacho getting its own railway stop. However, progress has been slow and we are looking for more skilled laborers.

Pay is 20 yen daily for those working locally and 23 yen for those working at the camp a half-day's walk from here.

Show up at 6 in the morning at the station to apply.
